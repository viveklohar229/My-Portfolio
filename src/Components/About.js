        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Vivek Vishwakarma, a passionate and dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer with hands-on experience in building modern, scalable web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and ASP.NET Core MVC. I have successfully developed full-featured projects like e-commerce platforms, admin dashboards, and donation systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development allows me to bring complete solutions to life — from responsive UI design to robust server-side logic and database integration. I’m also well-versed in cloud services like Cloudinary, version control with Git, and deploying applications to platforms like Render and Netlify.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to web development, I have real-world experience as a Desktop Support Engineer, where I specialized in system troubleshooting, network setup, and ensuring seamless IT operations. This unique blend of development and IT support makes me a problem solver who can work across both software and hardware challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m always excited to learn new technologies, take on meaningful projects, and collaborate with others to build impactful solutions.
